PotScript is a drag-and-drop block based language for creating 3D forms (especially vase like shapes). Also usable on mobile!

It's designed to be easy to use and to demonstrate an approach to integrating direct manipulation with a parametric design.

You can check out the technical details in our paper for SCF 2023 (link coming soon).
